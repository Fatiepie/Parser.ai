# Parser.ai
Welcome to the demo for Parser.ai, a NLP artificial intelligence system that parses sentences and extracts noun phrases from those given sentences given a list of non terminal words. 

Gary the AI, uses the NLTK library (Natural Language Tool Kit) for Python, that helps in the tokenization of the words for the AI to sense which words belong to which cluster (whether it is a noun phrase, a verb phrase, an adjective, and so on) and prints out a tree structure that shows the complete breakdown of the parsed words!

Hope you enjoy the Demo!
